#
### Python-APIs-Challenge
  In this challenge, I create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, we'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

• Demostrate the ability to access different APIs.

• Provde thorough analysis

#
### Matplotlib-Challenge
  Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. I can conclude after careful, and extensive analysis that: Capomulin was productive in reducing the tumor size over a 45 day period. There was a substantial correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume. Out of the four regimens(Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), Infubinol was the only drug with an outlier. To gather this data and form these conclusions, I did the following:

• Gather, clean, and merge data to perform analysis

• Use pyplot and matplotlib to display graphs, charts, and plots

• Utilize numpy and scipy for complex mathematical equations

#
### SQL-Challenge
  In this challenge, I show data analysis, data modeling/data engineering. I display the following:

• Inspect the CSVs to sketch out and design an ERD of the tables to hold the data in the CSVs. (QDB-Diagram)

• Import the CSVs into a SQL database.

• With the data gathered, create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 

• Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other neccessary constraints.

• Perform an in-depth analysis and run queries on the tables created

• Use and navigate PostgresSQL, a relational database management system

#
### SQL-Alchemy-Challenge
  In this challenge, I utilize advanced data storage and retrieval by displaying the following:

•	Connect to a SQL database using SQLAlchemy.

•	Perform basic SQL queries using engine.execute().

•	Create Python classes and objects.

•	Create, read, update, and delete data from a SQL database using SQLAlchemy's ORM.

•	Reflect existing databases.

•	Use the SQLAlchemy ORM to create classes that model tables.

•	Use the ORM to define relationships and foreign key constraints.

•	Use joins to query related data.

•	Extract query variable path values from GET requests.

•	Use variable paths to execute database queries on behalf of the client.

•	Return JSONified query results from API endpoints.

#
### Javascript-Challenge
  In this challenge, I write in JavaScript and use the D3.js library to display:
  
 • Use a provided dataset to form an array of JavaScript onjects
 
 • Append a table to my webpage
 
 • Add new rows of data
 
 • DOM manipulation
